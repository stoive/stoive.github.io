<h1>One last thing</h1>
<p>
	Before we start looking though the sample web app (this one!), it's worth
	mentioning this. HTML5 isn't finished, and it may never finish. Remember,
	this is a new approach to how innovation and HTML can work together.
</p>
<p>
	WHATWG, a spinoff of the W3C not bound by those cumbersome standardisation
	rules, calls HTML (without a version number) a
	'<a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/">living
	standard</a>'. Some sections are stable, some change hourly, and there's new
	APIs and standards added every month or so.
</p>
<p>
	Thanks!

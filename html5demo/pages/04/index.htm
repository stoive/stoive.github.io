<h1>But there's more...</h1>
<p>
	There's a couple of <em>BIG</em> shifts in how the Web is happening in the
	way it is run behind the scenes, and how users will see it work.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Previously</strong>, the W3C would write a standard, and have everyone (supposedly)
		playing along. <strong>But now</strong>, the browser vendors innovate first, and the W3C
		pulls it together into a standard.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Previously</strong>, the web would be experienced as a bunch of requests, for and
		responses of, boring old web pages. <strong>But now</strong>, a web site can be experienced
		as an application, like you'd have on the desktop, but immediately and 
		effortlessly distributable, installable, manageable and maintainable.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	This has nothing to do with some nifty little tags and a few extra
	JavaScript functions, but is a shift in the way developers <em>perceive</em>
	the Web.

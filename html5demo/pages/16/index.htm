<h1>...and on that topic</h1>
<p>
	There are a few features of HTML5 which work reliably all the way back to
	IE6 (with few hacks required). Think Web Sockets, SVG, video with flash
	fallback, local storage.
</p>
<p>
	Others won't work in older browsers, but what you're missing isn't that
	huge. Think back to the forms, which default to text fields. Or the
	animations and transitions - used a little bit here and there (which is the
	only non-nauseating way to do it, really), 50% of your users will have a 
	good experience, 50% will have a <em>great</em> experience.
</p>
<p>
	The question isn't, "is this supported by all the browsers I am targetting?"
	but rather a set of questions:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Is every browser supported natively?</li>
	<li>Can I get away with not supporting some browsers? (i.e. for mobile)</li>
	<li>Can the gaps be filled in, and the incompatibilities smoothed over, with
	some JavaScript library?</li>
	<li>Finally, what does the user lose if this isn't supported?</li>
</ol>
	</body>

<h1>Semantic elements</h1>
<p>
	Script and style elements no longer require language or type attributes.
	Name me a stylesheet that isn't CSS, or a script that isn't JavaScript?
</p>
<blockquote>
	<pre>&lt;script&gt;
	// here goes your JavaScript!
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
	/* here goes your CSS! */
&lt;/style&gt;</pre>

<p>Nothing exciting, but at least it's clean. There's also some niceties which
save you from having too many cases of &lt;div <strong>class="something"</strong>&gt;:</p>
<blockquote>
	<pre>header, footer, article, section, nav,
aside, hgroup, time, mark</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>...which might help with SEO and accessibility one day.</p>
<p>What's more exciting, is

which make use of microdata, microformats, and RDFa. These are currently used by
Google to display more detailed search results.</p>

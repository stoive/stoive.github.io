<h1>sessionStorage and localStorage</h1>
<p>
	Always wanted to persist data between page loads, without having to use some
	hack (like posting it back to the server, or putting it in location.hash)?
</p>
<p>
	sessionStorage is a key-value pair dictionary that can be
	accessed by pages from the same <em>domain</em> over the period of the
	<em>browser session</em>. It'll stick around through clicking links, back/forward
	navigation, and refreshing the page.
</p>
<label for="sessionstorage">Keep me for later:</label>
<input id="sessionstorage" type="text" />
<pre id="sessionstorage-value"></pre>
<script>
	$('#sessionstorage').change(function() {
		sessionStorage['eg'] = this.value;
		$('#sessionstorage-value').text(sessionStorage['eg'])
	});
	$('#sessionstorage-value').text(sessionStorage['eg']);
</script>
<p>
	localStorage is much the same, however the data remains in storage until it
	is explicitly removed - close the tab or browser, or reboot the machine, and
	the data will still be there.
</p>
<label for="localstorage">Keep me for much later:</label>
<input id="localstorage" type="text" />
<pre id="localstorage-value"></pre>
<script>
	$('#localstorage').change(function() {
		localStorage['eg'] = this.value;
		$('#localstorage-value').text(localStorage['eg'])
	});
	$('#localstorage-value').text(localStorage['eg']);
</script>
	</body>

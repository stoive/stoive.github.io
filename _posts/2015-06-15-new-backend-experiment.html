<p>I'm experimenting with using Jekyll as a backing engine for this site. Let's hope it works out!</p>
<p>You can still find the ever-useful Python tutorial link up top. Once I get the Git setup right, I'll be merging some pull requests that were submitted. With my copious free time.</p>
<p>Until then, don't get too lost.</p>

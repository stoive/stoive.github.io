		<p>When CivilizationTM IV (Firaxis Games, published by Take2) was announced, one of the most exciting features was that much of the scripting code will be in python, and the game data in XML. This tutorial attempts to teach you the basics of python programming that you could use with civIV.</p>
		<p>Of course, this tutorial is not limited to those who want to play a slow-paced turn-based strategy game. That is what it was written for, but is perfectly useful to any person with <b>no programming knowledge at all</b>, who wants to learn python. But what makes this tutorial unique, is that it is written for beginners, by a beginner.</p>

		<p>There is an abundance of functions that come with the Civilization IV scripting engine. There are around 130 different classes, all containing from a couple to dozens upon dozens of methods. The functionality is almost endless</p>
		<p>But how do we know what exists, and how we are supposed to use it? Here lieth the documentation for pretty much every class and method that Civilization IV python contains (as generated by the help() function, and put into a nice, neat web page).</p>

		<heading val="2" text="A Beginner's Python Tutorial" />
		<p>When CivilizationTM IV (Firaxis Games, published by Take2) was announced, one of the most exciting features was that much of the scripting code will be in python, and the game data in XML. This tutorial attempts to teach you the basics of python programming that you could use with civIV.</p>
		<p>Of course, this tutorial is not limited to those who want to play a slow-paced turn-based strategy game. That is what it was written for, but is perfectly useful to any person with &lt;b&gt;no programming knowledge at all&lt;/b&gt;, who wants to learn python. But what makes this tutorial unique, is that it is written for beginners, by a beginner.</p>
